### [Lasair Blog](https://community.lsst.org/c/sci/lasair-blog/67):

We really value feedback, especially from our users. 
Please ask your question or report your bug at

This way, the answer is already there when somebody else has the same issue.

However, if you really want to send email to the team, use lasair-help at mlist.is.ed.ac.uk.

### [Community Resources]({%lasairurl%}/comres/):

in this list, please make your resource public, and suggest it to us through Lasair Support
